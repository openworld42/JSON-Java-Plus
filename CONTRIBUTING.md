# Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to work on any open issue, you don't need to ask permission first.

If you discover an issue you would like to work on, you can add a new issue to the list. If it meets our criteria, it will be available to work on (if not, it will be closed after review).

# Who is allowed to submit pull requests for this project?

Anyone can submit pull requests for code, tests, or documentation.

# How do you decide which pull requests to accept?

* Is it a bug/feature/major user inconvenience that belongs to the basic implementation of JSON-java? Open an issue or PR [there](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/issues) - JSON-Java-Plus will integrate the fix from JSON-Java.
* Does it call out a bug that needs to be fixed? If so, it goes to the top of the list.
* Does it fix a major user inconvenience? These are given high priority as well.
* Does it align with the specs? If not, it will probably not be accepted. It turns out there are gray areas in the specs. If this is in a gray area, it will likely be given the benefit of the doubt.
* Does it break the existing behavior of the lib? If so, it will not be accepted, unless it fixes an egregious bug. This is happening less frequently now.
